   -1: remm: No, this gets called all the time, and we're trying to fix a small issue. The real
             solution would be to recycle the fields since as mentioned here it is the cause of 
             the problem (the "local" fields will often never change, but there's no real 
             guarantee overall - it mostly breaks down if there are multiple connectors, with AJP,
             and seems impossible to anticipate):
